Using the OWI robotic arm, we autonomously re-created the word "MIAMI" in Morse code.

**The truth:**

**Our original goal was to recreate digital art from bitmap images into analog art with the help of a robotic arm. Due to our inexperience, we chose to use DC motors and learned we could not achieve the amount of accuracy that were up to our standards. We now know of many different possible solutions that would have been better suited for our needs, after a lot of research and suggestions from our peers. To demonstrate the concept of a robotic arm drawing, we wanted to show that joints could be controlled to write in Morse-code.**
